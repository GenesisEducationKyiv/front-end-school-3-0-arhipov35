# Security Audit Report — MusicApp

## 1. Dependency Audit

To ensure the security of the project dependencies, the `npm audit` command was executed.

The audit identified 4 vulnerabilities:

- brace-expansion — Denial of Service vulnerabilities (low and moderate severity);
- react-router and react-router-dom — two high severity vulnerabilities;
- vite — moderate severity vulnerability.

To address these issues, `npm audit fix` was run.  
After updating and fixing dependencies, a re-audit showed **0 vulnerabilities found**.

Thus, all project dependencies currently have no known vulnerabilities and meet up-to-date security standards.

## 2. Zero-Day Vulnerabilities Check

While zero-day vulnerabilities cannot be detected by the standard `npm audit` command, an additional manual review was performed to ensure the installed packages do not exhibit suspicious or risky behavior.

Key dependencies (`react`, `vite`, `react-router-dom`, `zod`, `neverthrow`) were reviewed via the Socket.dev service. All of them:

- contain no unsafe scripts;
- do not use risky APIs;
- have high security ratings.

Therefore, all core dependencies are considered secure, and the risk of zero-day vulnerabilities is minimal.

## 3. Proposed Package Replacement

### Replacement: `bootstrap` → `tailwindcss`

Currently, `bootstrap` has no known vulnerabilities. However, based on analysis via Socket.dev and own assessment, a more secure and modern alternative — `tailwindcss` — was identified.

| Metric                 | bootstrap | tailwindcss |
|------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Supply Chain Security  | 99        | 100         |
| Quality                | 100       | 84          |
| Maintenance            | 85        | 98          |
| Vulnerability          | 100       | 100         |
| License                | 100       | 100         |
| Weekly Downloads (npm) | 4.6M      | 20M         |

### Reasons for Replacement:

- **Tailwind** has a higher Supply Chain Security score (100), indicating a lower risk of malicious behavior.
- **Tailwind** aligns better with React’s component structure and enables building UIs without extra CSS overhead.
- **Bootstrap** has a lower Maintenance score (85), suggesting less active support compared to Tailwind.

### Conclusion:

Based on security analysis, popularity, and architectural flexibility, it is recommended to replace `bootstrap` with `tailwindcss` to reduce future risks and improve integration with the modern React stack.
